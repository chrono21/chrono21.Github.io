										<h2 class="major">Proposal of Prosthetic ARM</h2>
										<p>The objective of this project is to develop a prosthetic arm with a robotic elbow joint that is highly articulated. The arm should have a range of motion of 90 degrees to the left and right, as well as up and down. The goal is to create a basic prosthetic arm that utilizes motors or servos to allow for a limited range of motion.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Optimizing Production: Key Considerations for Industrial Prosthetic Arm Manufacturing</h2>
										<p>The development process revealed that for large-scale production of prosthetic arms, several considerations come into play. Material selection becomes critical, as industrial applications might require stronger, more durable materials like medical-grade plastics or metals, balancing weight, and strength. Manufacturing processes such as injection moulding or CNC machining would be more efficient for mass production compared to 3D printing. Rigorous testing and regulatory compliance are essential for industrial prosthetics to undergo extensive testing for safety, durability, and compliance with medical regulations, which would require specialized facilities and expertise.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Additional Technologys</h2>
										<p> 3D Scanning Hardware </p>
										<p> Obtaining a 3D scan of the residual limb was a crucial first step in designing a prosthetic socket that fits comfortably and securely. Handheld scanners like Artec Eva are what we use for this purpose, as they can capture 3D scans of the user's limb in a matter of minutes.
										</p>	
										<p> Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Software</p>
										<p>This software is used to design the prosthetic components, including the socket, joints, and attachment mechanisms. The 3D scan data is imported into CAD software to create a digital model that can be customized to fit the user's specific needs and desired functionality. CAD software can also be used to test the design for strength and durability before it is printed.
										</p>
										<p>3D Modeling Software (alternative to CAD) </p>	
										<p>For prosthetics that require more organic shapes or a more user-centric design approach, 3D modelling software can be used alongside or instead of CAD. This software provides more creative freedom in shaping the prosthetic and can be used to create realistic, detailed models of the prosthetic components.
										</p>
										<p> Haptic Input Hardware & 3D Sculpting Software</p>	
										<p>Haptic input devices like haptic pens can be used with 3D sculpting software to refine the design and ensure a natural feel for the user. These tools allow the designer to manipulate the digital model in real time, making it easier to create complex shapes and contours that mimic the user's natural limb.
										<p>3D Printing Hardware & Workshop Facilities</p>
										</p>	
										<p>3D printing is used to create customized prosthetic parts, depending on the design and functionality requirements. Access to a workshop with tools for post-processing (cleaning, smoothing) 3D printed parts is essential to ensure the final product is of high quality and meets the user's needs.
										<p>Resin Production & Postproduction (for intricate parts) </p>
										</p>	
										<p>For prosthetics that require highly detailed or flexible components, techniques like resin production could have been used alongside traditional workshop processes for post-production finishing.
										<p> </p>
										</p>	
										<p>Composite Workshop Facilities: Composite materials might be used in prosthetic construction in some cases. A composite workshop would be required to work with these materials, as they require specialized tools and expertise to shape and finish. When combined, these tools allow for the creation of highly customized and functional robotic prosthetic arms that are tailored to the individual's unique needs. The result is a product that is comfortable, easy to use, and helps the user regain their independence and quality of life. </p>
